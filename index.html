		<p>The narrow, winding streets create quite a labyrinth and means that it may take a while to get your bearings. I recommend that you should always look up and around you or you may miss some of the best bits.</p>
		<p>The Gothic quarter has many peaceful squares (plaças) where you can relax and enjoy your surroundings. However one of the main attractions, right in the heart of the district is the huge Cathedral which has a stunning courtyard full of plants and oddly, geese.</p>

       <h2 id="gaudi">Gaudi Houses</h2>

       <p>Casa Vicens is a house in Barcelona, designed by Antoni Gaudí, now a museum. It is located in the neighbourhood of Gràcia on Carrer de les Carolines, 24. It is considered one of the first buildings of Art Nouveau and was the first house designed by Gaudí.</p>
       	<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/19/12/93/19129384f079146f8ab44ec024ef06b1.jpg" alt="pedreira." width="350" height="350">
       	<p> La Pedrera (1905), also known as Casa Mila, can be found at No 92 Passeig de Gràcia at the junction with Carrer Provenca. The word "Pedrera" means "Quarry" however the original name of the house was Casa Milà. This is another masterpiece by Antoni Gaudí and was designed as a fashionable home to the wealthy Milà family. The name Pedrera was used locally to describe the building because of its stone like appearance and the name stuck.</p>
       	<img src= "http://blog.lodgingapartments.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Batllo-1000x800.jpg" alt= "Batllo." width="350" height="350">
       	<p> The history behind Casa Batllo is an interesting one. Due to the poor architecture of the building, no one wanted to buy it until the Batllo family decided to take it because of its prime location. In 1904, the textile industrialist, Joseph Batllo appointed Gaudi to redesign the building. After the refurbishments were done, with the help of Gaudi’s many assistants, the Batllo family preserved the marvel for half a century until an insurance company took over. Later, it was redesigned and was brought back to its former glory before opening it for the visitors.</p>

        <p>Casa Batllo, located right in the center of Barcelona, was built by Antoni Gaudi in 1904. Casa Batllo is considered to be one of his finest works. Like any other marvels of Gaudi, this is another example of modern architecture. This building was remodeled from an old house.</p>
